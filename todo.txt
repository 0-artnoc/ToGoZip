todo.txt for k3b.add2Zip
=========

ToGOZip adds "Add To Zip" for the android system-events View/Send/SendTo/SendMultible

- files will only be added to "2go.zip" if there is not already a file with same name and same last-modified-date inside "2go.zip"
- if there is a file with the same name but a different last-modified-date inside "2go.zip" the file will be renamed in the zip
-- example: if adding file://sdcard/hello.txt and there is already a /hello.txt inside "2go.zip" with a differend last-modified-date the file will be added as /hello(1).txt
- Texts with 150 or more chars will be aded to a seperate file /text.txt or a renamed /text(1).txt, /text(2).txt, /text(3).txt, ....
-- example: 
--- after adding "some loo.....ng text" "2go.zip" contains /text.txt which contains "some loo.....ng text"
--- after adding "some ohter loo.....ng text" 2go.zip contains /text.txt with "some loo.....ng text" and /text(1).txt with "some other loo.....ng text"
- Texts shorter than 150 chars will be prepended to exactly one file /texts.txt. new texts come before old texts.
-- example: 
--- after adding "http://www.url.net/hello.htm" and then adding "this is some text" 2go.zip contains /texts.txt with 
----- this is some text
----- http://www.url.net/hello.htm
- if short texts are added on different calendar-dates there will be a separation line with date in the /texts.txt so you can see when the text was added.
-- example:
--- this is some text
--- ------------------- 2014-12-02 --------------------------
--- http://www.url.net/hello.htm" 2go.zip contains /texts.txt which contains http://www.url.net/hello.htm
- every generated file for text gets a banner "Collected with ToGoZip Version w.x.y.z"

The defaultvalues "file://sdcard/copy/2go.zip", text.txt, texts.txt and "150 chars" can be modified in the settings page.

ToGOZip "Add To Zip" iterpretes these types of eventdata
- if the eventdata is a local file with a file://-uri this local file is added to the rootdirectory of the zip.
- if the eventdata is a local folder with a file://-uri the content of the folder and all sub-folders are added to the zip with a correspondig zip-directory.
- if the eventdata is a content://-uri that can be translated to a local file, this file is added to the rootdirectory of the zip. This works for media data of type picture, video or audio.
- if the eventdata is a contet:// or file://-uri of a local file or folder that does not exist or that is not global readable, this uri is added as text-content to a text-file
- if the eventdata is some non-local uri (http:, https:, ftp:), this uri is added as text-content to a text-file
- if the eventdata is text or can be interpretet as text, this text is added as content to a text-file
