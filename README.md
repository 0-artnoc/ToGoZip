# toGoZip: "Add2Zip" for android share/sendTo menu.

Collect files into one zip-files while you are "on the go" or offline.

ToGoZip adds a "Add to Zip" menue entry into android's "share" or "send to" menu that is available in many apps.
Selecting "Add to Zip" will add the current Item(s)/File(s)/Folders into one zip.

This zip can be transfered later to an other computer using a
filemanager (i.e. [[org.openintents.filemanager]]), emailclient (i.e. [[com.fsck.k9]]),
nfc and/or bluetooth.

The program's author uses ToGoZip to collect new android calendar entries with [[de.k3b.android.calendar.ics.adapter]]
that should be later imported into the desctop-pcs-s calender.

'''Required Android Permissions:'''
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created/updated zip-file.
