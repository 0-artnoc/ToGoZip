''toGoZip: "Add2Zip" for android share/sendTo menu.''

Easy collection of files from every supporting app into one zip-file while
beeing 'on the go' or offline.

This collecting 2go.zip-file is like a suitcase where you can put things (files)
into from nearly everywhere (from every app that supports 'share'/'send to')
and that can travel everywhere (via email, bluetooth, nfc).

The program's author uses ToGoZip to collect new android calendar entries
([[https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/de.k3b.android.calendar.ics.adapter | ics-files]])
that should be transfered to the desctop-pcs-s calendar.

# Features:

* supports view/sendTo/SendMultible for file(s) and/or folder(s)
* automatic file-renaming in the zip if the same name with different file-date already exists.

'''Required Android Permissions:'''
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used to store the created/updated zip-file.
